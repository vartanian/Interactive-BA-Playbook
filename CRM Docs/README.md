THE XSLSX & CSV Files found in this directory are CRM tagging templates, structured for both spreadsheet review and CRM system import. They are Ready for Integration with:

- HubSpot: Import the CSV to create static lists, apply contact properties, or trigger workflows based on industry tags.

- Zoho CRM: Use during contact/lead import. Map “Industry” to a custom field, and “Tags” to multi-select or notes.

- Salesforce: Match “Industry” with standard field. Create custom fields for “Tags” and “Pitch Hook” or use CSV with Data Import Wizard.
