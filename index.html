    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A dashboard-style, multi-section SPA is used to transform the comprehensive report into a practical tool for a business broker. The structure is task-oriented, allowing the user to instantly access different components as needed (e.g., jumping from market data to specific rebuttals). A sticky navigation bar provides quick access to three core areas: 'The Foundation' (market context, seller psychology, and the broker's legal mandate), 'The Call Framework' (the complete, multi-stage script and objection handling), and 'The Toolkit' (post-call strategy and reference documents). This non-linear design is superior for the target user, who needs to find specific information quickly during call preparation or a live conversation. Key interactions include dynamic charts for NJ market data, clickable cards to explore detailed seller motivations, a searchable rebuttal matrix using the report's exact Acknowledge-Probe-Pivot structure, and interactive accordions for the detailed meeting agenda and checklists. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - NJ Business Data (Section 1) -> Goal: Inform/Contextualize -> Viz: Key Stat Cards + Bar Chart (Chart.js) -> Interaction: Hover tooltips -> Justification: Quickly visualizes the challenging market conditions (high taxes, inflation, labor issues) cited in the report.
        - Seller Psychology (Section 2) -> Goal: Inform/Guide -> Viz: Interactive Cards (HTML/CSS/JS) -> Interaction: Click a card (e.g., 'Burnout') to display detailed talking points on the 'Liberation and Legacy' theme -> Justification: Provides just-in-time messaging guidance based on the report's deep psychological analysis.
        - Broker's Mandate (Section 3) -> Goal: Establish Authority -> Viz: Styled Info Blocks -> Interaction: None -> Justification: Presents the critical NJ licensing and Statute of Frauds information as a foundation of trust.
        - Master Script (Sections 4-7) -> Goal: Guide Conversation -> Viz: Vertical Accordion (HTML/CSS/JS) -> Interaction: Click to expand each step of the call (Opening, Value Prop, Discovery, Close) -> Justification: Breaks down the detailed script into digestible, easy-to-follow stages with annotations.
        - Rebuttal Matrix (Section 8) -> Goal: Provide Instant Solutions -> Viz: HTML Table -> Interaction: Live search/filter bar -> Justification: A highly practical tool for finding the correct Acknowledge-Probe-Pivot response instantly during a call.
        - Deal Structures (Section 12) -> Goal: Compare/Educate -> Viz: Detailed HTML Table -> Interaction: Row highlight on hover/click -> Justification: Clarifies complex options (Asset vs. Stock, Earnouts) from the report in an easy-to-compare format.
